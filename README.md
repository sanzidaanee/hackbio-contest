This project is the Data4Life contest organized by Hackbio (2023). 

We (Team-Kalem)  are visualizing different datasets by using R and doing exploratory data analysis to identify 
the significant genetic variation among different populations and investigate the diversity in human sequencing projects.  
The data used from reference 1.
